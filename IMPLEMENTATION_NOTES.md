# Implementation Notes

## C Language Specifics
- Use malloc for dynamic memory
- Pointers for returning multiple values
- Array indexing from 0
- Remember to free allocated memory

## Language Considerations
- Different languages have different data structures
- Python: Lists and dictionaries
- Java: Arrays and HashMaps
- C: Arrays and custom hash implementations
