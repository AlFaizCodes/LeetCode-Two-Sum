# Performance Optimization Tips

## Brute Force Optimization
1. Early termination when solution found
2. Avoid redundant comparisons
3. Use efficient data structures

## Hash Map Benefits
- O(1) lookup time
- Single pass through array
- Trades memory for speed

## When to Use Each
- Small arrays: Brute force is fine
- Large arrays: Hash map recommended
- Memory constrained: Brute force
